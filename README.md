Steps Followed in notebook :-

1. Load data from file 
2. Identified and delt with missing data
3. Downsampling of data 
4. Formatted the data for SVM using OneHotEncoding
5. Built SVM for Classification
6. Optimized Support Vector Machines with Cross Validation
7. Built,Drew,interpreted and evaluated the final Support Vector Machine
